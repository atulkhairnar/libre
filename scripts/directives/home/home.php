                        <br>The Directive Principles of the Constitution direct the Indian State to

                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                            justice shall inform all the institutions of the national life [Article

                    <br>Unfortunately, the major political parties that dominate the Indian Parliament
                    have decided to abandon this vision of the founding fathers of the nation.
                    <b>Ever since they decided in 1991 to globalise the Indian economy, they
                        have been running the economy for the profit maximisation of giant foreign
                        and Indian corporations.</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>Giant corporations have launched a ferocious assault to dispossess the
                            poor of their lands, forests, water and resources — in order to set up
                            SEZs, huge infrastructural projects, golf courses, residential complexes
                            for the rich, etc.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Public sector corporations, including banks and insurance companies, are
                            being privatised at throwaway prices.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Indian agriculture is being deliberately strangulated — so that it can
                            be taken over by giant agribusiness corporations. The consequence: more
                            than 2.5 lakh farmers have committed suicide since the ‘reforms’ began.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Tens of thousands of small businesses have downed their shutters.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Welfare services are being privatised and for profiteering by corporations:

                                <li>Government hospitals and municipal schools are being privatised; medicine
                                    prices have zoomed; college fees have gone through the roof; electricity
                                    prices are rising; ration system is being eliminated; &nbsp;</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>There are simply no decent jobs for the youth; probably nearly half the
                            population is unemployed or underemployed.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>The country is heading towards an ecological catastrophe; corporations
                            are being allowed to cut down entire forests; destroy coastal lands, over-exploit
                            groundwater, pollute our seas-rivers-soil-groundwater-air, and damage our
                            health.</li>

                    <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>On the one hand, the rich are becoming extremely rich – the wealth of
                            India’s 56 Indian billionaires now equals 10% of the country’s GDP, and
                            the wealth of India’s richest 7800 people equals 50% of the country’s GDP;&nbsp;
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>on the other hand, the poor are becoming even more poor:&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nearly 75% of the population is not able to eat&nbsp;two
                                    full meals a day;&nbsp;
                                    <br>
                                </li>
                                <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50% children below the age of 5 are&nbsp;malnourished;&nbsp;
                                    <br>
                                </li>
                                <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;42% children drop out of school without completing
                                    basic schooling;&nbsp;
                                    <br>
                                </li>
                                <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lakhs of children die every year due to entirely preventable
                                    diseases; ...&nbsp;
                                    <br>
                                </li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>As the economic system becomes more and more sick, the social and political
                    system is also becoming more and more degenerate. All-pervasive corruption;
                    continuation of the age-old caste-based social system because of which
                    atrocities on dalits take place almost daily, and which is exploited by
                    politicians to make the upper caste youth believe that the reservation
                    system is responsible for lack of jobs; a communal political system that
                    divides people in the name of religion and fills them with hatred against
                    each other; a value system that promotes crass selfishness and unconcern
                    and apathy for others; a society where cynicism and moral bankruptcy permeate
                    every nook and cranny — this is the reality of today.&nbsp;
                    <br>
                    <br>The common&nbsp;people have not been silent spectators to this betrayal
                    of the Indian Constitution. Like flowers spring up in every nook and corner
                    with the onset of spring, people are coming together all over the country,
                    getting organised, forming groups and raising their voices in protest.
                    Though these struggles are presently small, scattered, without resources,
                    the future lies in these magnificent struggles. As more and more people
                    join them, they will strengthen, join hands, and become a powerful force
                    which will transform society.&nbsp;
                    <br>
                    <br>We must stop being sceptics, dream of a better future, believe that it
                    is possible to change the world. Yes, Another World is Possible! But to
                    make it a reality, we must start our own small struggles. These will ultimately
                    unite, to transform society and build a new society in accordance with
                    the dreams of our freedom struggle that are embedded in the Directive Principles
                    of the Indian Constitution. And so, we have started this forum, Lokayat.&nbsp;
