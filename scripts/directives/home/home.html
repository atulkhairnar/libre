                        <br>Unfortunately, the major political parties that dominate the Indian Parliament
                        have decided to abandon this vision of the founding fathers of the nation.
                        <b>Ever since they decided in 1991 to globalise the Indian economy, they
                            have been running the economy for the profit maximisation of giant foreign

                                poor of their lands, forests, water and resources — in order to set up
                                SEZs, huge infrastructural projects, golf courses, residential complexes

                            <li>Indian agriculture is being deliberately strangulated — so that it can
                                be taken over by giant agribusiness corporations. The consequence: more
                                than 2.5 lakh farmers have committed suicide since the ‘reforms’ began.&nbsp;

                                groundwater, pollute our seas-rivers-soil-groundwater-air, and damage our

                        <br>As the economic system becomes more and more sick, the social and political
                        system is also becoming more and more degenerate. All-pervasive corruption;
                        continuation of the age-old caste-based social system because of which
                        atrocities on dalits take place almost daily, and which is exploited by
                        politicians to make the upper caste youth believe that the reservation
                        system is responsible for lack of jobs; a communal political system that
                        divides people in the name of religion and fills them with hatred against
                        each other; a value system that promotes crass selfishness and unconcern
                        and apathy for others; a society where cynicism and moral bankruptcy permeate
                        every nook and cranny — this is the reality of today.&nbsp;
                        <br>
                        <br>The common&nbsp;people have not been silent spectators to this betrayal
                        of the Indian Constitution. Like flowers spring up in every nook and corner
                        with the onset of spring, people are coming together all over the country,
                        getting organised, forming groups and raising their voices in protest.
                        Though these struggles are presently small, scattered, without resources,
                        the future lies in these magnificent struggles. As more and more people
                        join them, they will strengthen, join hands, and become a powerful force
                        which will transform society.&nbsp;
                        <br>
                        <br>We must stop being sceptics, dream of a better future, believe that it
                        is possible to change the world. Yes, Another World is Possible! But to
                        make it a reality, we must start our own small struggles. These will ultimately
                        unite, to transform society and build a new society in accordance with
                        the dreams of our freedom struggle that are embedded in the Directive Principles
                        of the Indian Constitution. And so, we have started this forum, Lokayat.&nbsp;
