  "content" : "For the last two decades, the government of India has been attempting to gradually privatise the public &nbsp;&nbsp;sector insurance companies—the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the Oriental Insurance &nbsp;&nbsp;Company, New India Assurance, United India Insurance and National Insurance Company - which are &nbsp;&nbsp;amongst the best insurance companies in the world. In 1999, the government permitted private sector &nbsp;&nbsp;firms to enter both the life and non-life business, with a cap of 26% on foreign direct investment (FDI). &nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is attempting to get the Parliament to approve a proposal to increase the FDI limit from the &nbsp;&nbsp;present 26% to 49%; and dilute its holding in the public sector insurance companies—with the eventual aim of privatising them. The Finance Minister has repeatedly stated that these steps would increase &nbsp;&nbsp;the degree of insurance penetration in the country and mobilise much needed investments, including foreign capital, for India's infrastructural needs. He is lying! The performance of the Indian public sector insurance companies has been so remarkable that they have even been applauded by the IMF and World Economic Forum. With more privatisation and entry of foreign players, while none of the benefits the FM is claiming are going to take place, what is definitely going to happen is that frauds are going to increase, as private insurance companies are infamous for swindling policy holders.<br><br> <b>Insurance Penetration</b> <br>Insurance penetration is defined as the ratio of total premium income to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. The insurance penetration in India at 4.4% is actually higher than the global average of 4 per cent! In fact, it is also higher than the United States and Germany. This is all the more remarkable, considering the low income levels in India. The reason for this outstanding performance: the public sector insurance companies have strenously tried to expand their operations in the rural and semi-urban areas and provide insurance cover to millions of low- income households. <br><br><b>Investing Premiums for National Development</b><br> Ever since the nationalisation of insurance sector, the public sector insurance companies have contributed huge amounts to successive five- year Plans. LIC provided Rs. 7 lakh crores to the 11th 5-Year Plan (2007- 2012) while the four general insurance companies contributed about Rs. one lakh crore. Significant amounts of these investments are in socially purposive schemes, such as housing, rural electrification and municipal sewerage schemes, often at low interest rates. On an initial equity investment of Rs. 5 crores in 1956, the LIC paid out Rs. 1436 crores as dividend to the government in 2012-13.<br><br> Why will the private sector companies invest the funds mobilised by them according to national development priorities? Over the period 2005- 09, of the total infrastructural investment of Rs. 57,000 crores made by insurance companies, 90% was made by public sector companies; the share of the private sector companies was just 10%, despite the fact that they had a market share of 30-35% in new premium incomes.<br><br> <b>Claims Settlement</b><br> The most important criterion for judging an insurance company is its record of claims settlement. Insurance is a risky business. It is the promise by to pay the costs associated with some future event, based upon the payment of premium by the policy holder. Since this promise is an intangible, the insurance company, after mobilising massive sums, can just declare bankruptcy and vanish. This in fact was the reason why insurance was nationalised in India. In 1956, life insurance was nationalised; 245 Indian and foreign companies were taken over and amalgamated to establish the LIC. In 1971-72, general insurance was nationalised, four general insurance companies took over the business of 107 private companies, with the GIC as the holding company. Most of the big private insurance companies were controlled by India’s big business houses - the Birlas, Tatas, Singhanias and Dalmias – and they would often defraud their policy holders. Legislation had proven ineffective in checking these practices, and so they were nationalised. Commenting on their innumerable malpractices, the then Finance Minister, C.D.Deshmukh, stated in Parliament in 1956:<i> “... the number of ways in which fraud can be practised which was 42 in Kautilya’s days has risen to astronomical figures these days.”</i> Foreign companies are even more unscrupulous; they routinely pay policy holders as much as 40-70% less than what their policies promise when they suffer tragedies, and hundreds of insurance companies have even declared bankruptcy. A US Congress committee, set up in 1990 to investigate the huge number of bankruptcies in the insurance sector, stated in its report: <i>“...relatively few crooks, scoundrels and incompetents are capable of bankrupting huge companies and possibly the entire industry ... Fast operators in the industry are ignoring the rules, creating new schemes to enrich themselves, and walking away unscathed.”</i><br><br> Two decades later, things have not changed much. In 2008, the US insurance giant, American International Group (AIG), failed. It had made huge speculative investments in the stock market; when the stock market collapsed in 2008, its investments became worthless; the US government was forced to pour in $150 billion to bail it out, or else, it could have affected the stability of the entire financial system. In contrast, the Indian public sector insurance companies have been beacons of trustworthiness and reliability. On top of it, the claims settlement ratio for the LIC is an incredible 97%, a world record (and for non-life insurance, it is 74%); while the world average is an abysmal 40%. This is the real reason why they have been able to achieve such high levels of insurance penetration, and mobilise such huge amounts of premium— because the people know, their investments are safe; and in case they suffer a tragedy, they would get the compensation promised.<br><br> Why then is the Indian government seeking to privatise these extremely well-performing and profitable public sector insurance companies, and hand over their control to foreign crooks, scoundrels, fast operators? The reason: globalisation.<br><br> <b>Globalisation: India on SALE</b><br> In 1991, the Indian rulers, entrapped in a foreign exchange crisis of their own making, accepted World Bank-IMF conditionalities and decided to globalise the Indian economy and throw it open to foreign investment by the rapacious MNCs of the US and other developed countries. Even since then, the Indian government has been running the economy solely for the profit maximisation of foreign and Indian big business houses. One of the conditionalities of India's foreign creditors was that the government end its control of the financial sector, and allow foreign MNCs and Indian big business houses to take it over. Obediently, the government has been desperately trying to privatise the Indian insurance sector; if it proceeded slowly, it is only because of the strong resistance put up by the insurance sector employees.<br><br> Friends, the heroic struggle of the insurance sector employees has so far prevented the government from privatising public sector insurance and handing over control of people's savings to foreign brigands. With India's foreign debt rising to astronomical levels, the Indian economy is now even more in the clutches of foreign corporations and speculators, and they are increasing pressure on the government to privatise the insurane sector. If they succeed in having their way, then not only will the future development of the country will be affected, the very safety of people's investments/savings will be at stake—government guarantee will end, and it is not unlikely that the foreign companies may one day choose to declare bankruptcy and vanish, leaving millions of people in deep financial crisis. Therefore, it is important that we join insurance employees to demand:<br> <b>1) Stop dilution of government holding in public sector insurance <br>2) Scrap Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill</b>"}
