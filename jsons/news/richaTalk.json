			"Listen to this intrepid activist and student leader, an M.Phil Gold Medallist, founder of Stri Mukti Sangathana in 2008, who defied the patriarchal pastures of the Hindi belt and Hindutva wave sweeping through the country to stand as an independent candidate for the Presidentship of the Allahabad Students Union. And in a place where student politics follows the trajectory of mainstream politics and is submerged in money power, where candidates openly flaunt party colours with little regard to norms, where election rallies openly flaunt country-made pistols and rivals are routinely attacked with crude bombs, Richa Singh refused to bow before the intense pressure mounted on her to withdraw her candidature, and actually won the elections!"
